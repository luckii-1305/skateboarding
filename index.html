                    <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize">One of the most basic tricks</h5>
                    <p class="text-muted text-left">Invented in the late 1970s by Alan "Ollie" Gelfand, the ollie has become a skateboarding fundamental, the basis for many other more complicated tricks.</p>

                    <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize">Opposite of the ollie</h5>
                    <p class="text-muted text-left">This is a reverse version of Ollie. In this trick, you need to raise the nose of the skateboard as you jump rather than the tail. Keep your back foot at the center of the board and place your front foot at the front. As you jump, raise the front of the board from the ground and level the board while in the air.</p>

                <!--3rd Trick-->

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="https://www.skatereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Skateboard-Trick-Heelflip.webp">

                    <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>kickflip trick</kbd></h4>
                    <hr>
                    <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize">Basic and simple for noobies</h5>
                    <!-- Give text-muted below to show the text in grey color-->
                    <p class="text-muted text-left">This is one of the most basic tricks any new entrant to skateboarding can try and excel in. It involves lifting the wheels of your deck from the ground to 180 degrees by leaning back on the board to raise the nose. This can be done on the ramp or on the ground, and it gives you an accurate and quick turn. Kick-turn is the best way to start learning more straightforward skills before moving on to more complex ones.</p>

                <p class="col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">By the early 1950s, surfing can be traced as the source of skateboarding. Some surfers had the idea to transfer the feeling of riding waves onto the streets to defy times of days with a gentle swell. Not without any reason these dudes were called “asphalt surfers”. At two spots in the world a kind of a skateboard was developed at the first time in the early 1950s: California and Hawaii. They used shorter surfboards and wheels made out of metal without some bearings. In the late 1950s, skateboarding had a first peak. During the post-war period, the U.S. economy boomed and this also affected the toy industry. During that time, the toy industry became aware of the board with wheels. In 1959, Roller Derby released the first official skateboard with some new technical developments. Thereby, the handling characteristics have been improved. For this reason, skateboarders were able to develop new tricks and maneuvers.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">In the early 1990s, skateboarding went through a further depth phase due to the increase in various trend sports. So skateboarding went back to its roots. But because of the digitalization, skateboarding maintained its presence in public. From the mid-1990s, the modern skateboarding experienced a next high phase, which continues until today. Mega events like the “X-Games” were launched and televised. Due to numerous magazines, all the events, videos and last but not least the internet, skateboarding became common worldwide.
                <br>
                Because of brands like Chocolate, Girl Skateboards or Flip Skateboards, the skateboarding hardware was developed more and more and skateboarders could buy high-quality skateboards in every bigger city.
                <br>
                More indicators are the big and worldwide known events of “Street League”. “Street League Skateboarding” is a contest series for international pro skaters. Here, you only see the best street skateboarder you can think of like Nyjah Huston, Eric Koston, Paul Rodriguez, Andrew Reynolds, Ryan Sheckler or Torey Pudwill. Due to the cash prizes of 200.000 US Dollars or more for the winner and 10.000 visitors at the “Street League” stops, skateboarding has become a professional sport.
                <br>
                In Germany, street skating is the most popular discipline at contests just like in the USA. The European and German skate scene is independent, has its own industry, pros and a national contest series. This is an evidence of how big the role of skateboarding is in our society.
                <br>
                Skateboarding has become a job for a lot of people. Because of the increasing networking inside the skate scene, skateboarding will grow and bring more innovations in the future. But for the most of us, skateboarding is and will be a hobby and an attitude to life.
